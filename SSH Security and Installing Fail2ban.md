# Secure SSH and Install Fail2ban

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Edit SSH Configuration:**
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```
   - Uncomment and modify settings such as:
     - `Port` to change the SSH port if desired.
     - `PermitRootLogin no` to disallow root login.
     - `PasswordAuthentication no` to disable password-based authentication.
     - `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no` to disable challenge-response authentication.
     - `PubkeyAuthentication yes` to enable public key authentication.
   - Save the file (Ctrl + X, Y to confirm, Enter).

## Explanation

- **Editing SSH Configuration:** This step involves modifying the SSH server configuration file to enhance security by disallowing root login, disabling password authentication, and enabling public key authentication.
- **Restarting SSH Service:** Ensures that the SSH server applies the new configuration without requiring a system reboot.
- **Installing Fail2ban:** Adds an additional layer of security by automatically blocking IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior.

By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your SSH server and protect against unauthorized access attempts.
